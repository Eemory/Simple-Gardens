# Simple-Gardens
Simple Gardens is a full-stack web-application that I built using React and Firebase. It is intended to be used as a garden diary that allows a user to create a page for each of their plants. Allowing the user to store an image and information on their plant, as well as make notes about their plant as they need to. The home page includes an index of the plants they have created, along with a to-do list feature to keep track of tasks they might need to do in their garden.
