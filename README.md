# Simple-Gardens
Simple Gardens is a full-stack web-application that I built using React and Firebase. It is intended to be used as a garden diary that allows a user to create a page for each of their plants. Allowing the user to store an image and information on their plant, as well as make notes about their plant as they need to.
